# World Happiness
<p>The world happiness report is an annual report that is published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This survey was formerly taken in the year 2012. The world happiness report records the happiness score for 156 countries based on various attributes. In this repository, we use the "World Happiness" dataset for the year 2015-2020 and try to understand the factors that influence the score of happiness. Later, we will play around with the dataset and build a predictive model. A detailed visual report is made within the Jupyter Notebook as well as with Tableau.</p>
<p>This dataset can be found on Kaggle through the following link <br><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report">World Happiness is the need for the hour</a></p>
<p>This repository will contain <br> 
1. Links to Tableau Public in "README.md" - Detailed visualization of finding can be obtained <br>
2. Tableau Workbook as  "World Happiness.twb" <br>
3. Jupyter Notebook as "World Happiness.ipynb" <br></p>
<h1> Tableau Public</h1><br>
<h3>1. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ginelle.d.souza#!/vizhome/1WorldHappiness/Happinesswithrespecttocountries">Happiness per country</a></h3><br>
<p>World Happiness is a survey of 156 countries this visualization shows the separation of happier and lesser happier countries over the years.</p>

<p>There are several attributes in this dataset, through this visualization, we will understand the relation between these attributes and their distinct features.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ginelle.d.souza#!/vizhome/3WorldHappiness/Impactoftrustandeconomyonhappiness">Impact of trust and economy</a></h3><br>
<p>Trust in the government and the economic conditions play an important role in the happiness within countries.</p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ginelle.d.souza#!/vizhome/4WorldHappiness/EffectofEconomyonFreedom">Effect of Economy on Freedom</a></h3><br>
<p>We have seen how trust and economy influence the happiness score, but the economy may not always have a positive outcome on all attributes. Freedom is one attribute that speaks a different story.</p>
